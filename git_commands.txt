to create first repository : 
> git init
creates .git directory and intializes HEAD pointer for the master branch of the repository
> git init NewDir

to add files to the staging area :
> git add filename1 dir1 dir2
or
> git add . or git add -A
The git add command does not add the .gitignore file by default. In fact, we can ignore the files by this command.
To undo an add operation, run the below command:
git reset <filename>

To commit the code in to local repository :
> git commit 
> git commit -a 
The commit command also provides -a option to specify some commits. 
It is used to commit the snapshots of all changes. This option only consider already added files in Git. It will not commit the newly created files.
> git commit -m
This commit command is uses to commit our code with valid message.
> git commit -am "some message"
>git commit -amend
The amend option lets us to edit the last commit.
If accidentally, we have committed a wrong commit message, then this feature is a savage option for us.
